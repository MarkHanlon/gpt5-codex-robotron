# gpt5 Robotron Remix

A fast-paced twin-stick shooter inspired by *Robotron: 2084* and powered by [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). Dash through a neon arena, dodge relentless robots, and light up the screen with colorful particle explosions.

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the game:

   ```bash
   python -m robotron_remix.main
   ```

The game window will open and begin spawning enemies immediately.

## Controls

- **WASD / Arrow Keys** – Move the player.
- **Arrow Keys** – Fire in the pressed direction (supports diagonals).
- **Esc** – Quit the current run.
- **Enter** – Restart after a game over.

## Gameplay Tips

- Your blaster leaves shimmering trails—use them to feel your momentum and kite enemies.
- Particle bursts mark enemy spawns; dive in to intercept new waves quickly.
- Keep moving to stay alive; standing still invites swarms from all sides.

Enjoy the chaos!
